# Ring over Network

A small ring network simulator over a (more simulated) physical network.

## Compile the project

Use the ./compile.sh script to compile the application.

## Run the project

A few topologies are provided on the data folder. You can use them to test the application.

A script that runs the full project will be provided soon. For now, please run the command lines in run_node and adapt them to change the configuration file and/or the physical id for the node you are launching.
